# Shell
This is a basic implementation of a Linux Shell made as part of an assignment for Uni that can handle some of the most common commands and features found on a standard shell.
  
 - It uses the **lreadline** library for reading, history management and the autocomplete feature. To install this library run `sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev` and use the `-lreadline` flag when compiling.
